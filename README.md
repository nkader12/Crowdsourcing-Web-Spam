# Crowdsourcing for Web Spam Detection using Blockchain Technology

The prevalence of spam websites on the internet has created a demand for accurate web spam detection models. However, these models often struggle with the dynamic nature of spam websites and the use of advanced evasion techniques by spammers. To address this challenge, we propose a mechanism that incentivizes users to submit high-quality data to improve our web spam detection model.

Drawing on previous works, including Harris and Waggoner's Decentralized & Collaborative paper, we aim to modify their incentive mechanism to better fit our needs and provide a simpler alternative to their proposed solution. Our goal is to create an effective incentive mechanism that promotes high-quality contributions from users, while deterring bad actors from submitting inaccurate or malicious data.

Through this research, we hope to demonstrate the potential of incentivized crowdsourcing as a strategy for improving the accuracy of web spam detection models. Our proposed mechanism has the potential to address the limitations of existing models and provide a more reliable and effective solution for crowdsourcing data and combating spam websites.
